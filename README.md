#  Key Features

###  SQL (Data Engineering)
- Performed data extraction, exploration, and cleaning on **6,000+ customer records**.  
- Built **ETL workflows** with staging and production tables.  
- Created **business-ready SQL views** to feed into Python models and Power BI dashboards.  

###  Python (Machine Learning)
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** achieving **84% accuracy**.  
- Conducted **feature engineering & importance analysis** to identify key churn drivers (contract type, monthly charges, support services).  
- Automated churn prediction for new customers and exported **churn-risk reports** in CSV format.  

###  Power BI (Business Intelligence)
- Designed **interactive dashboards** tracking churn KPIs by gender, age, contract, state, and payment method.  
- Revealed key insights:  
  - **Overall churn rate:** 27%  
  - High churn among **monthly contract customers & fiber optic users**  
  - **380 high-risk customers** identified for targeted retention campaigns
